# CS370-StudentInformationSystemSecurity

Our final for CS370, computer security is to build a simple student database web server with basic security controls

For our web server we will use a framework called Flask, which is a standard web server program that is simple to use for the purposes of this assignment. We will use Flask for all of the Graphic User Interface requirements. Flask will contain the software that allows users to edit the appropriate data. The actual data will be stored in a SQLite which has the functionality of a SQL database, but stored conveniently in a single document. The SQLite document will store all user information including login credentials, and student information.

SQLlite as database (editable document that is easier to manipulate than MySQL)
Flask as frontend software (similar to Python)
